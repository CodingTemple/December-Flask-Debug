# Flask Debug Project

In this project you are given a flask application that has a good amount of bugs and your job is to find and fix them.

Keep in mind the steps that we went over during this week's lectures. Also keep in mind the errors that I purposly showed in class. Some of them may be found here.

Once finished, commit the finished project to github and submit the link to the google classroom assignment.

## Note
Your project is complete when:
- You can signup for a new user account
- Sign in with that user
- Create posts and display them to your front page
